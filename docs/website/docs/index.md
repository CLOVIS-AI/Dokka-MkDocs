# Welcome!

Dokka in Material for MkDocs is a Gradle plugin using Dokka to extract documentation comments (KDoc) and embed them in a generated website.

- [**Get started**](setup.md)
- [**Visit the demo**](api/-library%20module/index.md)

This plugin should work for any kind of project supported by Dokka: Kotlin/JVM, Kotlin/Multiplatform, etc.
This also includes extracting Java source comments from mixed Java/Kotlin projects.

This project is very early in development. If you find something missing, or a stability issue, please [create an issue](https://gitlab.com/opensavvy/automation/dokka-material-mkdocs/-/issues/new) or [email us](mailto:contact-project+opensavvy-automation-dokka-material-mkdocs-60473792-issue-@incoming.gitlab.com).
