# Module Library module

This is a demonstration of how to use the Dokka format.

This text is written in a markdown file that is included in the library module. Dokka uses it to generate the module and package headers.

In this file, you can include code:
```kotlin
println("Hello world!")
```
as well as other Markdown features, like quotes:

> This is a quote.

## This is a subheader

Module pages can have subheaders to describe multiple sections of content.

# Package opensavvy.dokka.material.mkdocs.example

This is the description of a package.
