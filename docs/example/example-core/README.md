# Module Library module

Welcome to Dokka in Material for MkDocs!

This page is the documentation header for the `example-core` module. It is declared using Dokka's `includes` functionality to use Markdown documents to describe modules and packages.

In this file, you can include code:
```kotlin
println("Hello world!")
```
as well as other Markdown features, like quotes:

> This is a quote.

## This is a subheader

Module pages can have subheaders to describe multiple sections of content.

The behavior is identical to Dokka's headers mechanisms.

# Package opensavvy.dokka.material.mkdocs.example

This is the description of a package.

The description may be arbitrary long, but only the first paragraph is displayed in the module page.
Therefore, this sentence doesn't appear in the module page, but does appear in the paragraph page.
